### Description

Just some sorting routines for strings.

### Building

Stringsort and the test programs will build with any modern Fortran compiler. A [Fortran Package Manager](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm) manifest file (`fmp.toml`) is included, so that the library and tests cases can be compiled with FPM. For example:

```
fpm build --profile release
fpm test --profile release
```

To generate the documentation using [ford](https://github.com/Fortran-FOSS-Programmers/ford), run:

```
  ford stringsort.md
```

**Note: Stringsort builds and runs fine with gfortran 7, but seems not to work with some later versions. Everything works fine with the Intel Fortran compiler**
